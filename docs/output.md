# wal-yan/picard-profiler: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [FastQC](#fastqc) - Raw read QC
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Picard](/modules/nf-core/picard/) - All metric, mapping, and dictionary results `(dont know how best to describe this, but all picard metric results?)`
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

> **NB:** The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads. They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

[Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) is a set of command line tools that is used for manipulating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data in formats such as BAM. All results generated through picard related tools come as a standalone file, as well as a matched pdf plot for visualisation purposes.

The output within the `picard/` directory correlates to two picard tools, these being `CollectHsMetrics` and `CollectMultipleMetrics`. 

#### `CollectHsMetrics`

The `CollectHsMetrics` tool collects hybrid-selection (HS) metrics for SAM/BAM files that are specific for sequence datasets generated through hybrid-selection. This tool is most useful for capturing exon-specific sequences for targeted sequencing experiments such as exome sequencing. 

#### `CollectMultipleMetrics`

The `CollectMultipleMetrics` tool allows for the running of multiple metric collection tools. 

* `CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics` which produce metrics detailing the quality of read alignments and the proportion of reads that passed quality filters, these metrics are interpreted as percentages but presented as fractions. 
* `CollectBaseDistributionByCycle` charts the nucleotide distribution per cycle in a BAM file, producing a chart to assess any systematic errors at specific read positions. Able to be inferred are miscalled bases through reflections in distribution changes, sequencing errors, and trimming quality, find here [Interpretation notes](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#CollectBaseDistributionByCycle)
* `CollectInsertSizeMetrics` provides metrics for validation of library construction, including the distribution of insert size and read orientation of pair ended libraries. Depending on the type of library preparation used these metrics will vary. Output inclues percentages of read pairs in each orientation as a histogram, as well as the insert size distribution as a histogram and txt file.
* `CollectQualityYieldMetrics` provides metrics about reads passing quality thresholds and Illumina-specific filters. The overall quality of the reads within a BAM file are analysed, and output indicates the total number of bases within reads that pass the minimum base quality score and Illumina quality filter thresholds. Included here are the quality by cycle, quality distribution, and read length metric files.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
